	How to add things to my online version of my website

</p>

<ol>
	<li> open my terminal and navigate to my falder by typing cd./desktop/c27jn.github.io</li>

	<li> If I want to see what I changed a particular day, I can type 'git status'
 and it can show me my changes </li>

 	<li> To add what I changed, I type <b> git add .</b> </li>

 	<li>Then I should commit my chnages and this means adding a sentence or note that explains what I chganged so I say <b>git commit -m "whatever I did"</b></li>

 	<li>To finalize everything and put it online on my website, I type <b>git push</b></li>


</ol>
