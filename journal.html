		This is my first journal entry. I recently learned how to create a text link to link two pages together and click back and forth between the two. At first I was just using images for the links but recently using text also works.
	<h1></h1>

	<p>
		Today we learned about...

	</p>

	<p>
		Last class we set up our github websites by linking the website folder to a github account through the terminal. We started to learn how to update our website after making changes.

	<p>
		How to add things to my online version of my website

	</p>

	<ol>
		<li> open my terminal and navigate to my falder by typing cd./desktop/c27jn.github.io</li>

		<li> If I want to see what I changed a particular day, I can type 'git status'
	 and it can show me my changes </li>

	 	<li> To add what I changed, I type <b> git add .</b> </li>

	 	<li>Then I should commit my chnages and this means adding a sentence or note that explains what I chganged so I say <b>git commit -m "whatever I did"</b></li>

	 	<li>To finalize everything and put it online on my website, I type <b>git push</b></li>


	</ol>

		Today 10/06/2023: There is a major error in my website, linking the home page with my projects page. I have spent most of today's class trying to fix it. Currently, it still displays an error when clicked. I'm not sure what the issue is. I'm have a few more thoughts about how to fix it, but not completely sure how these ideas will fit in. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Today 10/13/2023: I finally fixed the big problem that I had when linking my projects page from my index. The issue was that I had used the wrong casing when using the a link tag. Now that all the minor problems have been fixed, the main part of my website is fixed and complete, now I can start adding the different projects, as well as adding other aspects to my website. In our last class, we created something using java script, and also created a new boxes project. 

	</p>
		Today 10/24/2023: Last class I had started working on my jumpscare for Halloween. Today I continued finishing the jumpscare by adding more images that continue the chain of clicks, as well as improving some aspects of the jumpscare such as the image size. Originally I had just linked the scare image to another page, but then I added a 2nd scare image which I tried using javascript for aspects such as opacity changing, and adding another image upon click. I also added text to the jumpscare images to enhance the effectiveness of the jumpscare. However, I need to add sound to the jumpscare to further improve it, it won't fully be functional without a sound file added. This is what I am trying to figure out how to do.

		Today 11/14/2023 A function is a recipe that takes data in and the function processes the intaked data and does something based upon the processed data. This class I figured out how to change the image on click using the add Event Listener. I am using that to create a garden project. I am still trying to figure out how I can have an image following my mouse so that the image changes on click or something similar.

	</p>

	<p>
		11/17/2023 - I touched up my garden project and had different plants appear from a seed, or soil or a short flower and then a grown one appeared. This class I learned how to have a image follow my cursor. I made it a hose to enhance the project. I used a client x and client y, and then I had to make the hose under the images. After doing this my garden project is complete. 

	</p>

	<p>
		12/01/2023 - The gratitude card utilizes many elements such as javascript. Inside, I utilize variables as well as event listeners to create the gratitude card. Also, outside of javascript, I styled the text and image background. When you click onto the page, a picture of Dalton appears. There is a little text box saying 'click' (I need to make this clearer) After you click on the image of Dalton, a gratitude letter in white text appears on top of the image with Dalton in the background. My card thanks some of the essential people at Dalton
	</p>

	<p>
		Today 12/12/2023 - Today I finished and tried to edit and refine the numbered boxes project with an add event listener.
	</p>

	<p>
		Today 01/09/2024 - Today we started to use arrays to create projects such as random pickers, and lists to help facilitate these projects and make them more advanced and complex. Creating a variable with a list, numbers each member of the list so then those numbers can be used to pick some items at random. To advance this concept, I could apply divs to a list to create some images in the list which would allow for some more advanced projects.

	</p>

	<p>
		01/26/2024 - Today I finished my array project. I used a list to store a list of images. These images were related to breakfast foods and drinks. The point of the project is to allow the user to click through the program when they are struggling to find out something to eat. They can click on an originally blank plate to click through different breakfast food options. The user can also click through an originally empty glass to find different drinks. The randomness of this program in producing different food and drinks is cultivated through the use of math.random which created a random number with parameters and then this number corresponds to one of the items in the list. There is also a place where the user can submit their feedback to the website. 
	</p>

	<p>
		02/09/2024 - Today I completed my preliminary version of my Valentines Project. I have a few shapes which you can click to see a message about Valentines Day. I might make future versions where there are images are behind the shapes, and maybe the images could move around as well. This could be a future iteration of this project.
