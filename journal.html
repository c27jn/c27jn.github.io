		This is my first journal entry. I recently learned how to create a text link to link two pages together and click back and forth between the two. At first I was just using images for the links but recently using text also works.

	<p>
		Today we learned about...

	<p>
		Last class we set up our github websites by linking the website folder to a github account through the terminal. We started to learn how to update our website after making changes.

		How to add things to my online version of my website

	</p>

	<ol>
		<li> open my terminal and navigate to my falder by typing cd./desktop/c27jn.github.io</li>

		<li> If I want to see what I changed a particular day, I can type 'git status'
	 and it can show me my changes </li>

	 	<li> To add what I changed, I type <b> git add .</b> </li>

	 	<li>Then I should commit my chnages and this means adding a sentence or note that explains what I chganged so I say <b>git commit -m "whatever I did"</b></li>

	 	<li>To finalize everything and put it online on my website, I type <b>git push</b></li>


	</ol>

		Today 10/06/2023: There is a major error in my website, linking the home page with my projects page. I have spent most of today's class trying to fix it. Currently, it still displays an error when clicked. I'm not sure what the issue is. I'm have a few more thoughts about how to fix it, but not completely sure how these ideas will fit in.

		Today 10/13/2023: I finally fixed the big problem that I had when linking my projects page from my index. The issue was that I had used the wrong casing when using the a link tag. Now that all the minor problems have been fixed, the main part of my website is fixed and complete, now I can start adding the different projects, as well as adding other aspects to my website. In our last class, we created something using java script, and also created a new boxes project.

		Today 10/24/2023: Last class I had started working on my jumpscare for Halloween. Today I continued finishing the jumpscare by adding more images that continue the chain of clicks, as well as improving some aspects of the jumpscare such as the image size. Originally I had just linked the scare image to another page, but then I added a 2nd scare image which I tried using javascript for aspects such as opacity changing, and adding another image upon click. I also added text to the jumpscare images to enhance the effectiveness of the jumpscare. However, I need to add sound to the jumpscare to further improve it, it won't fully be functional without a sound file added. This is what I am trying to figure out how to do.
