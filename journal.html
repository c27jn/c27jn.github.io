This is my first journal entry. I recently learned how to create a text link to link two pages together and click back and forth between the two. At first I was just using images for the links but recently using text also works.


<html>

<head>
	<style type="text/css">
		
		}
		
	</style>

</head>
<body>
<a href="index.html">
	Go home

</a>
</body>
